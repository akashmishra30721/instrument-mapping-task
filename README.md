# instrument-mapping-task

Each broker provides a file containing a list of instruments they support. However, the same instrument might have different names across brokers, and identifiers (IDs) are unique to each broker. For example, "Reliance Industries" might appear as "RELIANCE IND" in one broker’s data and "REL INDUST" in another’s.

The main objective of this project is to create a unified mapping of financial instruments across multiple brokers—Kotak, Fyers, Angel One, and Zerodha. Each broker provides a unique identifier for the financial instruments they support, and this project aims to consolidate these IDs into a single table with accurate mappings.
